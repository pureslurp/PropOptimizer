## Usage

### Saving Weekly Props (New!) ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: You MUST save props BEFORE games start each week. The Odds API only provides current props - once games are played, you cannot retrieve historical prop lines!**

**Build a historical database by saving props each week:**

```bash
# Auto-detect current week and save props (run this weekly!)
python3 save_weekly_props.py

# Manually specify a week
python3 save_weekly_props.py --week 6

# Test without saving (dry run)
python3 save_weekly_props.py --dry-run
```

**When to run:** Before games start each week (Tuesday-Friday recommended)

**Data location:** Props are saved to `2025/WEEK{X}/props.csv` in each week's folder

See [WEEKLY_PROPS_GUIDE.md](WEEKLY_PROPS_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

### Main Interface

1. **Select Stat Type**: Choose from:
   - Passing Yards
   - Passing TDs
   - Rushing Yards
   - Rushing TDs
   - Receptions
   - Receiving Yards

2. **Select Week**: 
   - **Current Week (X)**: Live props from Odds API
   - **Week 1, 2, 3...**: Historical props with actual results (requires saved data)

3. **Apply Filters**:
   - **Minimum Score**: Filter results by score threshold (0-100)
   - **Confidence Level**: Filter by High/Medium/Low confidence predictions

4. **View Results**: The dashboard displays:
   - Player name and opposing team
   - Team defensive ranking
   - Prop line and odds
   - **Actual stat** (past weeks only): Color-coded result vs. prop line
     - üü¢ Green = went OVER the line
     - üî¥ Red = went UNDER the line
   - Overall score (0-100)
   - Key statistics: L5, Home/Away performance, Season over rate
   - Confidence level
   - Historical over rate
   - Analysis summary

### Understanding the Scores

The scoring system combines four key factors:

1. **Matchup Score (35%)**: Based on opposing team's defensive ranking
2. **Player History Score (30%)**: Based on player's historical performance vs. the line
3. **Consistency Score (20%)**: Based on player's performance consistency
4. **Value Score (15%)**: Based on betting value (odds vs. probability)

**Score Interpretation**:
- 80-100: üî• Excellent opportunity
- 70-79: ‚úÖ Strong play
- 60-69: üëç Good value
- 50-59: ‚öñÔ∏è Neutral
- 0-49: ‚ùå Avoid

## Customization

### Adding New Stat Types

To add new stat types, update the `stat_types` list in the main application and add corresponding mappings in the `OddsAPI.parse_player_props()` method.

### Modifying Scoring Weights

Adjust the scoring weights in `scoring_model.py`:
```python
weights = {
    'matchup': 0.35,      # Team defensive ranking
    'player_history': 0.30, # Player historical performance
    'consistency': 0.20,   # Player consistency
    'value': 0.15         # Betting value
}
```
