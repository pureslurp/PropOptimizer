## Customization

### Adding New Stat Types

To add new stat types, update the `stat_types` list in the main application and add corresponding mappings in the `OddsAPI.parse_player_props()` method.

### Modifying Scoring Weights

Adjust the scoring weights in `scoring_model.py`:
```python
weights = {
    'matchup': 0.35,      # Team defensive ranking
    'player_history': 0.30, # Player historical performance
    'consistency': 0.20,   # Player consistency
    'value': 0.15         # Betting value
}
```
