# API Optimization Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The application was making **73% MORE API CALLS than necessary** due to inefficient alternate lines fetching.

## 📊 Before Optimization

### API Calls Per Refresh:
1. **1 call** - Get events list
2. **5 calls** - Get main player props (one per game)
3. **35 calls** - Get alternate lines (7 stat types × 5 games)

**Total: ~41 API calls per refresh**

### The Issue:
The `fetch_alternate_lines_for_stat()` method was making a **separate API call for each stat type for each game**:
- Passing Yards Alternates: 5 calls (one per game)
- Rushing Yards Alternates: 5 calls
- Receiving Yards Alternates: 5 calls
- Receptions Alternates: 5 calls
- Passing TDs Alternates: 5 calls
- Rushing TDs Alternates: 5 calls
- Receiving TDs Alternates: 5 calls

This is wasteful because **the API can return multiple markets in a single call**.

## ✅ After Optimization

### API Calls Per Refresh:
1. **1 call** - Get events list
2. **5 calls** - Get main player props (one per game)
3. **5 calls** - Get ALL alternate lines (one call per game for ALL stat types)

**Total: ~11 API calls per refresh**

### The Solution:
Created `fetch_all_alternate_lines_optimized()` which:
- Makes **1 API call per game** instead of 7
- Requests ALL alternate markets in a single call: `player_pass_yds_alternate,player_rush_yds_alternate,player_reception_yds_alternate,...`
- Parses all stat types from the single response

## 📈 Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| API Calls per Refresh | 41 | 11 | **73% reduction** |
| Calls per Game (alternates) | 7 | 1 | **86% reduction** |
| Refreshes per 20K quota | ~488 | ~1,818 | **3.7x more usage** |

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### `odds_api.py`
- **Added:** `fetch_all_alternate_lines_optimized()` - New optimized method
- **Marked deprecated:** `fetch_alternate_lines_for_stat()` - Old inefficient method (kept for compatibility)

### `player_prop_optimizer.py`
- **Updated:** Changed from loop calling `fetch_alternate_lines_for_stat()` for each stat type
- **To:** Single call to `fetch_all_alternate_lines_optimized()` that fetches all at once

### Key Code Change:
```python
# OLD (INEFFICIENT):
for stat_type in stat_types_in_data:
    alt_line_manager.alternate_lines[stat_type] = alt_line_manager.fetch_alternate_lines_for_stat(stat_type)
    # Makes 5 API calls × 7 stat types = 35 calls

# NEW (OPTIMIZED):
all_alternate_lines = alt_line_manager.fetch_all_alternate_lines_optimized()
alt_line_manager.alternate_lines = all_alternate_lines
# Makes only 5 API calls total (one per game)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Monitor API usage** with: `python3 check_api_usage.py`
2. **Use caching** - Avoid hitting "Refresh" unless necessary
3. **Consider upgrading** to higher tier if needed (but now you'll get 3.7x more value)

## 💡 Additional Optimization Ideas

If you still need to reduce API calls further:

1. **Increase cache duration** - Cache data for longer periods
2. **Selective stat fetching** - Only fetch stat types user is interested in
3. **Schedule-based fetching** - Only fetch when games are approaching
4. **Reduce games checked** - Currently checks up to 15 games to find 5 with props

## 📝 Testing

To test the optimization:
1. Clear cache and hit "Refresh"
2. Run `python3 check_api_usage.py` before and after
3. You should see ~11 requests used instead of ~41

## 🎉 Result

With this optimization, your 20,000 request quota now gives you:
- **~1,818 refreshes** instead of ~488
- That's **3.7x more app usage** from the same quota!
