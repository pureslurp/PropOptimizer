# Game Time Filter Implementation

## Overview
Added game time filtering to prevent fetching props and alternate lines for games that have already started or finished.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `odds_api.py`

#### Import Changes
- Added `timezone` to datetime imports to properly handle UTC time comparisons

#### `OddsAPI.get_player_props()` method
- Added filtering logic after fetching events from the API
- Compares each event's `commence_time` against current UTC time
- Only processes events that haven't started yet
- Filters out events with:
  - No `commence_time` field
  - Invalid time format
  - Start time in the past

#### `AlternateLineManager.fetch_alternate_lines_for_stat()` method
- Added the same filtering logic before fetching alternate lines
- Prevents API calls for games that have already begun
- Reduces unnecessary API usage and respects rate limits

## Implementation Details

### Time Handling
- Uses `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` to get current time in UTC
- Parses API's ISO 8601 format timestamps (handles 'Z' suffix)
- Ensures timezone-aware comparison between current time and game start time

### Error Handling
- Safely handles events with missing `commence_time`
- Catches parsing errors for invalid time formats
- Skips problematic events rather than failing the entire fetch

## Testing

Created `test_game_time_filter.py` to verify:
- ✅ Past events are filtered out
- ✅ Future events are included
- ✅ Events without `commence_time` are filtered out
- ✅ Events with invalid time format are filtered out

## User Experience Impact

### Automatic Filtering
- When the app loads, only active games are fetched
- The "Refresh" button will automatically apply the filter when re-fetching data

### Benefits
1. **Accuracy**: Users only see props for games that haven't started
2. **API Efficiency**: Reduces unnecessary API calls
3. **Performance**: Faster data loading by skipping completed games
4. **Data Quality**: Prevents stale odds from being displayed

## No Breaking Changes
- All filtering is transparent to the user
- Existing functionality remains unchanged
- No changes to UI or user workflows required
