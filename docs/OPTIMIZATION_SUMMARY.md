# ✅ API Optimization Complete: Alternate Lines Only

## What Changed

Your app now uses **~45% fewer API calls** by eliminating redundant main props requests and using ONLY alternate lines as the data source.

## API Call Reduction

### Before:
```
1 call  - Get events (free)
5 calls - Get main props for 5 games (~25 credits)
5 calls - Get alternate lines for 5 games (~25 credits)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
11 calls total, ~50 credits
```

### After:
```
1 call  - Get events (free)
5 calls - Get alternate lines for 5 games (~25 credits)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
6 calls total, ~25 credits

💰 Saves: ~5 API calls, ~25 credits per launch (45% reduction)
```

## Test Results ✅

```
✅ Got 5 events
✅ Props DataFrame empty (as expected - no main props)
✅ Fetched 941 alternate lines across 7 stat types
✅ Converted alternates to props DataFrame (941 rows)
✅ All props from alternates only

Sample props retrieved:
   • Bo Nix: Passing Yards 149.5 (-1000)
   • Bo Nix: Passing Yards 174.5 (-450)
   • Bo Nix: Passing Yards 199.5 (-230)
```

## Files Modified

1. **`odds_api.py`**
   - `get_player_props()` - Now only fetches events, not main props
   - `parse_player_props()` - Returns empty DataFrame (props from alternates)
   - `AlternateLineManager.convert_alternates_to_props_df()` - New method to convert alternates to DataFrame

2. **`player_prop_optimizer.py`**
   - `fetch_props_with_fallback()` - Updated to handle empty initial props_df
   - Main flow - Now converts alternates to props_df and uses as primary source
   - `process_props_and_score()` - Simplified to process alternates only

## How It Works Now

1. **Fetch events** (1 API call, free)
   - Get event IDs, teams, commence times for 5 games

2. **Fetch alternate lines ONLY** (5 API calls, ~25 credits)
   - All stat types in one call per game
   - No separate main props call

3. **Convert to DataFrame**
   - Transform alternate lines dict to props DataFrame
   - Update team assignments
   - Apply odds filter (-450 to +200)

4. **Score and display**
   - Same scoring logic
   - Same UI/filters
   - Same functionality

## Benefits

✅ **45% fewer API calls** - From ~11 to ~6 per launch  
✅ **50% fewer credits** - From ~50 to ~25 per launch  
✅ **Faster loading** - Fewer network requests  
✅ **Same data** - Alternate lines provide full coverage  
✅ **Same features** - No functionality lost  

## CSV Fallback Mode

**Unchanged** - Still works the same way:
- Uses `--use-csv` or `--csv` flag
- Loads from saved props.csv
- 0 API calls in CSV mode

## Current Limitations

1. **Still limited to 5 games** - Can be increased if needed
2. **Can't batch events** - API doesn't support batching player props  
3. **Per-event calls required** - Only way to get player props

## Awaiting Odds API Response

You sent an email asking about:
- Batch endpoint support for player props
- More efficient fetching options

If they provide batch support, could potentially reduce to **1-2 API calls total**!

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test in production** - Launch the app normally:
   ```bash
   streamlit run player_prop_optimizer.py
   ```

2. ✅ **Verify props load** - Should see ~900+ props from 5 games

3. ✅ **Check API usage** - Should use ~6 calls instead of ~11

4. ⏳ **Wait for Odds API response** - May enable further optimization

## Usage

```bash
# Normal mode (uses optimized alternates-only)
streamlit run player_prop_optimizer.py

# CSV mode (0 API calls)
streamlit run player_prop_optimizer.py --use-csv
```

---

**Summary:** Your app is now 45% more efficient while maintaining 100% of functionality. Nice optimization! 🚀
