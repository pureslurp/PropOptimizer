# Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored `player_prop_optimizer.py` to improve code organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `odds_api.py` (431 lines)
Moved all Odds API-related code to a dedicated module:
- **OddsAPI class**: Handles fetching player props from The Odds API
  - `get_player_props()`: Fetch player props for NFL games
  - `parse_player_props()`: Parse API response into DataFrame
  - `update_team_assignments()`: Map players to their teams
  - `get_player_team_from_data()`: Team lookup helper
  - Team name mapping dictionaries (abbreviations ↔ full names)
  
- **AlternateLineManager class**: Manages alternate betting lines
  - `fetch_alternate_lines_for_stat()`: Fetch alternate lines in real-time
  - `get_closest_alternate_line()`: Find closest line to target
  - Stat type to market mapping

### 2. Consolidated `utils.py` (422 lines)
Merged `utils.py` and `utils_other.py` into a single unified utilities module:
- **Player name cleaning**: `clean_player_name()` with comprehensive name mappings
- **Team utilities**: 
  - `TEAM_DICT`: Abbreviation → team name mapping
  - `CITY_TO_TEAM`: City → team name mapping
  - `get_team_abbreviation_mapping()`: Full name → abbreviation
  - `normalize_team_name()`: Standardize team names
  
- **Display formatting**:
  - `format_odds()`: Format American odds for display
  - `format_line()`: Format betting lines based on stat type
  
- **Statistical calculations**:
  - `calculate_last_n_over_rate()`: Over rate for last N games
  - `calculate_streak()`: Consecutive games over the line
  - `calculate_70_percent_threshold()`: Find optimal betting threshold

### 3. Cleaned `player_prop_optimizer.py` (591 lines, down from 1,457!)
Removed:
- ❌ OddsAPI class (→ odds_api.py)
- ❌ AlternateLineManager class (→ odds_api.py) 
- ❌ DataProcessor class with mock data (obsolete)
- ❌ PropScorer class (obsolete, using AdvancedPropScorer instead)
- ❌ Mock/demonstration data functions
- ❌ Helper functions (→ utils.py)
- ❌ Team mapping dictionaries (→ odds_api.py and utils.py)

Kept:
- ✅ Streamlit UI code only
- ✅ Main application flow
- ✅ Data display and formatting logic
- ✅ Column explanations section

### 4. Deleted Files
- ❌ `utils_other.py` - functionality merged into `utils.py`

### 5. Updated Imports
- Updated `dfs_box_scores.py` to use `from utils import clean_player_name`

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each file now has a single, clear responsibility
   - `player_prop_optimizer.py`: Streamlit UI
   - `odds_api.py`: API interactions
   - `utils.py`: Utility functions

2. **Improved Maintainability**: 
   - 60% reduction in main file size (1,457 → 591 lines)
   - Easier to find and modify specific functionality
   - No duplicate code between utils files

3. **Better Reusability**:
   - OddsAPI can be used by other scripts
   - Utils can be imported anywhere they're needed
   - Clean module boundaries

4. **No Mock Data**: Removed unused mock/demonstration data that was taking up space

## Next Steps

Consider further refactoring opportunities:
- Extract styling functions from `player_prop_optimizer.py` to a `ui_helpers.py`
- Move export logic to a separate module
- Create a `constants.py` for shared constants
